Main article: Mormon Tabernacle Choir Christmas discography
Since its first recording in 1910, the choir has earned five gold albums (two in 1963: The Lord's Prayer and Handel's Messiah; one in 1979: The Joy of Christmas; and two in 1985: The Mormon Tabernacle Choir Sings Christmas Carols and Joy to the World) and two platinum albums (in 1991, Hallmark Christmas: Carols of Christmas and in 1992, Hallmark Christmas: Celebrate Christmas!). The choir has made over 300 recordings and continues to produce albums. For some live performances and albums, the choir has collaborated with large orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra, the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra of London, the Boston Pops Orchestra, and the newly formed Orchestra at Temple Square.  The choir's own record label was formed in 2003.

Several award-winning popular artists have reflected on the beauty of the choir's music publicly including: Bryn Terfel,[60] Gladys Knight (of Gladys Knight and the Pips),[61] Sting (of The Police),[62][63] James Taylor,[64] Ric Ocasek (of The Cars),[65] and The Osmonds.[66]
