Frankenthaler received the National Medal of Arts in 2001.[25] She served on the National Council on the Arts of the National Endowment for the Arts from 1985 to 1992.[26] She wrote in The New York Times in 1989 that government funding for the arts was "not part of the democratic process" and was "beginning to spawn an art monster"; the NEA's budget was reduced shortly thereafter.[27] Her other awards include First Prize for Painting at the first Paris Biennial (1959); Temple Gold Medal, Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, Philadelphia (1968); New York City Mayor's Award of Honor for Arts and Culture (1986); and Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement, College Art Association (1994).[28] In 1990 she was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full Academician in 1994.

Frankenthaler did not consider herself a feminist: she said "For me, being a 'lady painter' was never an issue. I don't resent being a female painter. I don't exploit it. I paint."[29] "Art was an extremely macho business," Anne Temkin, chief curator at the Museum of Modern Art, told NPR. "For me, there's a great deal of admiration just in the courage and the vision that she brought to what she did."[30]

In 1953, Kenneth Noland and Morris Louis saw her Mountains and Sea which, Louis said later, was a "bridge between Pollock and what was possible."[31] On the other hand, some critics called her work "merely beautiful."[30] Grace Glueck's obituary in The New York Times summed up Frankenthaler's career:

Critics have not unanimously praised Ms. Frankenthaler's art. Some have seen it as thin in substance, uncontrolled in method, too sweet in color and too "poetic." But it has been far more apt to garner admirers like the critic Barbara Rose, who wrote in 1972 of Ms. Frankenthaler's gift for "the freedom, spontaneity, openness and complexity of an image, not exclusively of the studio or the mind, but explicitly and intimately tied to nature and human emotions.[4]
Helen Frankenthaler Foundation[edit]
The New York-based Helen Frankenthaler Foundation, established and endowed by the artist during her lifetime, is dedicated to promoting greater public interest in and understanding of the visual arts.[32][33]
