Helen Frankenthaler was born on December 12, 1928 in New York City.[3] Her father was Alfred Frankenthaler, a respected New York State Supreme Court judge.[3] Her mother, Martha (Lowenstein), had emigrated with her family from Germany to the United States shortly after she was born.[4] Her two sisters, Marjorie and Gloria, were six and five years older, respectively. Growing up on Manhattan's Upper East Side, Frankenthaler absorbed the privileged background of a cultured and progressive Jewish intellectual family that encouraged all three daughters to prepare themselves for professional careers. Her nephew is the artist/photographer Clifford Ross.[5]

Frankenthaler studied at the Dalton School under muralist Rufino Tamayo and also at Bennington College in Vermont.[3] While at Bennington College, Frankenthaler studied under the direction of Paul Feeley, who is credited with helping her understand pictorial composition, as well as influencing her early cubist-derived style.[6] Upon her graduation in 1949, she studied privately with Australian-born painter Wallace Harrison,[7] and with Hans Hofmann in 1950.[8][9]  She met Clement Greenberg in 1950 and had a five-year relationship with him.[4] She was later married to fellow artist Robert Motherwell (1915â€“1991), from 1958 until they divorced in 1971.[10] Both born of wealthy parents, the pair was known as "the golden couple" and noted for their lavish entertaining.[4]  She gained from him two stepdaughters, Jeannie Motherwell and Lise Motherwell.[4] In 1994, she married Stephen M. DuBrul, Jr., an investment banker who served the Ford administration.[4]
