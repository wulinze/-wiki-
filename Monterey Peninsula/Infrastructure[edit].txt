California State Route 1 is the major north-south highway through the area. Although it travels along the coast for most of its length, Highway 1 bypasses the immediately coastline of the Monterey Peninsula and instead primarily travels inland on the eastern side of the area as a freeway. California State Route 68 provides access east to Salinas.

The proposed Monterey Peninsula Water Supply Project includes a desalination facility and additional aquifer storage capacity that is intended to provide a reliable, long-term water supply. The project will use subsurface slant wells that draw from a brackish aquifer that consists mostly of seawater located just behind the coast line. Since the intake does not reach into the ocean, potential harm to sealife can be avoided.[16] The wells drawing the water for desalination must not access the Salinas Valley Groundwater Basin.[17]  The California state water board originally set a deadline of December 31, 2016 to reduce pumping from the Carmel River by 70%.[16] The project has the support of Peninsula mayors water authority together with local business and community leaders. The Marina Coast Water District and Ag Land Trust have concerns about the test well pumping impacts on the areaâ€™s groundwater supply and would prefer a full environmental impact report be prepared for the project.[18]
