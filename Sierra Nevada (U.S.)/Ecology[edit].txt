Main article: Ecology of the Sierra Nevada
 Tuolumne Meadows is an example of a subalpine meadow in the Sierra.
The Sierra Nevada is divided into a number of biotic zones, each of which is defined by its climate and supports a number of interdependent species.[21] Life in the higher elevation zones adapted to colder weather, and to most of the precipitation falling as snow. The rain shadow of the Sierra causes the eastern slope to be warmer and drier: each life zone is higher in the east.[21] A list of biotic zones, and corresponding elevations, is presented below:

The western foothill zone, 1,000–2,500 ft (300–760 m),[21]:92 with grassland, oak-grass savanna and chaparral-oak woodland.[28] North of Sequoia National Park, Gray pine (also known as digger pine) is intermixed with the oak woodland.[21]:95
The Pinyon pine-Juniper woodland, 5,000–7,000 ft (1,500–2,100 m) east side only.[21]:92
The Sierra Nevada lower montane forest (indicator species: Ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine), 2,500–7,000 ft (760–2,130 m) west side, 7,000–9,000 ft (2,100–2,700 m) east side.[21]:92 This biotic zone is notable for containing Giant Sequoia.
The upper montane forest (indicator species: Lodgepole pine, Red fir) 7,000–9,000 ft (2,100–2,700 m) west side, 9,000–10,500 ft (2,700–3,200 m) east side.[21]:92
The Sierra Nevada subalpine zone (indicator species: Whitebark pine)[36] 9,000–10,500 ft (2,700–3,200 m) west side, 10,500–11,500 ft (3,200–3,500 m) east side[21]:92
The alpine region at greater than 10,500 ft (3,200 m), and greater than 11,500 ft (3,500 m) east side.[21]:92
