 The Living Learning Community on-campus housing complex
 Students have access to Aggie Legacy Fields which are equipped with durable astroturf and lighting for after-dark activities.
Utah State is the largest public residential campus in the state, and nearly 18,000 students live on or directly adjacent to campus.[75] The university is the center of activity for the entire area, and the campus community is considered very close-knit. 21 widely varying on-campus buildings house single students, and 39 buildings on the north side of campus are available for married housing.[78] Many more students live in the multitude of off-campus housing options nearby. Students on campus may choose to dine in one of two cafeterias, as well as the Quadside Cafe at Merrill-Cazier Library which offers paninis, soups, beverages, and more.  There is also a full-service Skyroom restaurant, and the Hub, which includes a number of dining options.[79] On the east edge of campus sits Aggie Ice Cream, a local tourist hotspot dating back to 1888, which produces "world-famous" ice cream and cheese products, as well as sandwiches and soups.[80]

 Utah State University's Aggie Recreation Center was completed in 2015.
Starting out in Old Main, USU has had a creamery since its founding in 1888.[81] Students studying dairying and domestic arts applied to learn how to make both ice cream and cheeses. In 1921, Gustav Wilster began working with the College of Agriculture, and by 1922, students were studying dairy technology, fluid milk processing, ice cream manufacture, dairy engineering, cheese manufacture, butter making, dairy facility inspection, and dairy product judging.[81] Wilster's students would go on to create Casper's Ice Cream, Farr's Ice Cream, and Snelgrove's Ice Cream. In 1975, the Nutrition and Food Sciences building was built, which is where Aggie Ice Cream is housed today.[82] Aggie Ice Cream receives its milk from the Caine Dairy Research and Teaching Center located near the Wellsville Mountains.[81]

Along with Aggie Ice Cream, well-known traditions include the rite of passage of becoming a True Aggie, which requires a student to kiss someone who is already a True Aggie on top of the Block "A."[83] Two students may also become True Aggies together on Homecoming night or on A-Day.[84] At one point recently, USU held the title in the Guinness Book of World Records for the most couples kissing at the same place at the same time.[75] Nearby the Block "A" is the lighted "A" atop the Old Main tower, which shines white throughout the entire valley, and blue on nights when a varsity sport has picked up a victory, or other special events have occurred on campus.[85]

 Utah State University USUSA student body officers from the 2016-2017 school year
Every student at Utah State is represented by the USUSA (Utah State University Student Association) which is composed of 17 elected student officers and 5 appointed student officers.[86] These officers typically oversee a certain area of responsibility that is outlined in each officer's charter. Responsibilities of USUSA officers can range from overseeing campus events and activities to promoting and advocating for particular initiatives at the Utah State Legislature. In February of each school year, campaigns are launched by students who wish to serve in the following year's USUSA. Campaigns last one week and consist of a primary and general election in which the top two vote-getters from the primary advance to the general election and the candidate who receives a majority vote in the general election is announced as the winner.

The USUSA received significant attention during the 2016-2017 school year when the organization declared a mental health crisis at Utah State University.[87] The legislation (written by USUSA Student Body President Ashley Waddoups, USUSA Student Advocate Vice President Matthew Clewett, and USUSA Graduate Studies Senator Ty Aller) sought to raise awareness of significant wait times for students to utilize CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services) at Utah State as well as the increasing number of students who were suffering from mental health related illnesses. After a successful lobbying campaign, the USUSA was able influence the Utah State Legislature to pass a resolution declaring a mental health crisis at all USHE (Utah System of Higher Education) institutions.[88] The resolution was subsequently signed by Utah Governor Gary Herbert in March 2017.

Students have full access to the HPER (pronounced "hyper"), Nelson Fieldhouse, and the ARC (Aggie Recreation Center) exercise facilities which include basketball courts, indoor rock climbing, gymnastics equipment, two swimming pools, racquetball, squash, and outdoor field space for lacrosse, rugby, soccer, ultimate, and other sports.[89] USU students are also involved in more than 100 clubs, an active and influential student government, seven fraternities and three sororities, multiple intramural and club sports, and a student-run radio station.[90]

In 1970, Utah State student Sue Brown and Director of Student Activities Val R. Christensen created one of the first service organization in the nation.[91] VOICE, Volunteer Organization for Involvement in the Community and Environment, worked to improve the environment and social issues in Cache Valley. VOICE became The Val R. Christensen Service Center in 1999 in honor of Dr. Christensenâ€™s efforts and support of the organization.[92] Today, students are involved in more than 20 service organizations including Aggie Special Olympics, Aggies for Africa, Alternative Breaks, and Senior University.[93]
