Founded in 1888, Utah State University is the agricultural college and land grant institution for Utah.[95] In 1903, USU was divided into five schools: the School of Agriculture, the School of Agricultural Engineering and Mechanical Arts, the School of Home Economics, the School of General Science, and the School of Commerce.[37] In 1907, the State of Utah prohibited USU from providing degrees in teaching and engineering (to prevent competition with the University of Utah).[37] In 1923, the University expanded to six academic colleges: Agriculture, Home Economics, Agricultural Engineering, Commerce and Business Administration, Mechanic Arts, and General Science.[37] In 1924, the institution added a School of Education, and restructured the School of General Science to include a School of Basic Arts and Sciences.[37]

Today, USU is organized into nine academic colleges:[96]

Caine College of the Arts[edit]
 Manon Caine Russell Kathryn Caine Wanlass Performance Hall
Formerly existing as a non-degree-granting institution within the College of Humanities, Arts & Social Sciences, the Caine College became a free-standing college on July 1, 2010.[97] The Caine College of the Arts houses the departments of Art & Design, Music, and Theatre Arts, along with the Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art.[98] Performance facilities include the Chase Fine Arts Center, which houses the Kent Concert Hall among other venues, and the free-standing Manon Caine Russell-Kathryn Caine Wanlass Performance Hall,[76] completed in 2006.  The 400-seat Performance Hall, designed by the architectural firm Sasaki Associates, has been praised as one of the best acoustic performance spaces in the American West, and received an Honor Award from the Utah Chapter of the American Institute of Architects.[99] The Nora Eccles Harrison Museum of Art, designed by architect Edward Larrabee Barnes and opened in 1982, contains one of the largest art collections in the Intermountain Region.  Its holdings include nationally significant collections of ceramics, Native American art, and especially artworks produced in the American West since 1945.[100]

USU's music program includes faculty Dean Craig Jessop, longtime director of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, as well as opera singer Michael Ballam, pianist Gary Amano, and the Fry Street Quartet, USU's string quartet-in-residence.[101]

College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences[edit]
The College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences was the first academic college at USU, and is known for ground-breaking animal genetics and human nutrition and food science research, as well as other significant breakthroughs and global outreach in plants and soil science, animal science, veterinary science and economics and applied agriculture. College researchers were instrumental in the creation of the first cloned equines (horses), in a project collaboration with researchers at the University of Idaho.[102] The college is also a leader in the international project to classify and research the sheep genome.[103] The College of Agriculture includes six departments: Applied Sciences, Technology & Education (Aviation Technology);[104] Animal, Dairy & Veterinary Sciences; Applied Economics; Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning; Nutrition, Dietetics & Food Sciences; and Plants, Soils & Climate.[105]

The College is also home to Utah's first Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) program. The program is a regional program in collaboration with Washington State University in Pullman, Washington.[106] Each year, the program accepts 20 Utah residents and 10 non-Utah residents. Students spend their first two years receiving pre-clinical training at USU’s Logan campus. They spend the final two years at WSU’s College of Veterinary Medicine in Pullman, Washington completing the clinical portion of their veterinary education.[107]

The College is also known for the production of its nationally known, award-winning Aggie Ice Cream and cheeses, through its Nutrition and Food Science Department.

In 2013 the name of the College was changed from the College of Agriculture to the College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences to reflect the broad nature of the college.[108]

College of Engineering[edit]
 The David G. Sant Engineering Innovation Building
Much of USU's most widespread academic renown stems directly from the College of Engineering. USU houses the Space Dynamics Laboratory (SDL) which is a research facility focusing on military and science applications.[109] The SDL frequently submits projects to the Department of Defense and NASA.[110][111] According to recent National Science Foundation statistics, USU ranked first among all universities in the U.S. in funding for aerospace research.[112]  USU has also won multiple national aerospace engineering competitions in the past, including two in the 2008–09 academic year alone.[113]

The Utah Water Research Laboratory is the oldest and largest facility of its kind in the nation.[114] USU is considered the world's No. 1 university in a number of water-related engineering and scientific disciplines due in large part to the UWRL.[citation needed] The lab heads and contributes to numerous international projects, particularly in arid Middle Eastern nations.[115]

College of Humanities and Social Sciences[edit]
 The Ray B. West Building houses the College of Humanities and Social Sciences' Department of English.
The College of Humanities and Social Sciences touches nearly every student on campus through its teaching of required general education classes.[citation needed] The College houses eight departments and more than 30 programs.[116] Departments include English, history, journalism and communication, languages, philosophy and speech communication, military science, political science, sociology, social work and anthropology.[117]

In the Humanities, USU has long history in the study of the American West.[118] The university, through its departments of English and history, respectively, is the host institution for the scholarly journals Western American Literature and the Western Historical Quarterly, the official publications of the Western Literature Association and the Western History Association, respectively.[119]  The Mountain West Center for Regional Studies, a Humanities outreach center at USU, sponsors public events and research focusing on the cultures and history of the Interior West and larger American West.[120] University Special Collections and Archives, located at the Merrill-Cazier Library, has extensive archival holdings documenting the histories of Utah, the Intermountain West, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as well as one of the nation's largest collections pertaining to American folklore, and the lives and works of western authors such as Jack London and poet May Swenson, a Logan native and USU alumna.[121][122][123][124]

The college also houses the USU Museum of Anthropology, currently located in Old Main.[125]

College of Science[edit]
Among the most notable aspects of USU's College of Science includes the rate at which its students are accepted into medical and dental schools.[126] Despite the absence of such professional schools on site in Logan, students are admitted to medical and dental programs at a rate of nearly 30 percent above the national average each year. This is due in large part to the rigorous Prehealth Advising Program and resources like the Cadaver Lab, to which undergraduates have access.[127]

In the past decade, the Physics Department alone has produced a Rhodes Scholar, a Marshall Scholar, a Fulbright Student Scholar, nine Goldwater Scholars, and two Carnegie Professors of the Year.[128]

The College of Science houses the Departments of Biology, Chemistry & Biochemistry, Physics, Computer Science, Mathematics & Statistics, and Geology.[129] The Department of Mathematics & Statistics includes one of only three actuarial science programs in the American West.[130]

Emma Eccles Jones College of Education and Human Services[edit]

USU's Emma Eccles Jones College of Education and Human Services was founded in 1924. With around 5,700 students, the College has been placed in the top 2% of the U.S. News and World Report best graduate schools of education in the U.S. for the past decade.[131][132] The college ranks 4th nationally in external funding for all colleges of education.[131] The college is accredited by the American Psychological Association.[133]  Faculty are active in many of areas of research, including neuropsychology, child development, health psychology, behavior therapy, and quantitative psychology. The college has a nationally recognized department of Instructional Technology and award-winning faculty in the area of learning sciences.[134] The Department of Special Education and Rehabilitation is ranked in the top 10 nationally according to US News & World Report.[131]

Department of Psychology professor Karl R. White is director of the National Center for Hearing Assessment and Management, which focuses on the early identification and intervention of hearing loss in infants and young children.[135]

USU is the only university in the state of Utah to have a Housing & Financial Counseling program offered through the college's department of Family, Consumer, and Human Development.  This program offers debt counseling, budget counseling, mortgage default prevention counseling, and reverse mortgage counseling through the USU Family Life Center,[136] which also houses the Marriage & Family Therapy Clinic.[137]

 The Jon M. Huntsman School of Business completed construction on its expansion in 2016.
In 2007, Utah State's College of Business became the Jon M. Huntsman School of Business after a $26 million donation by the philanthropist Jon Huntsman, Sr.[138]

The Huntsman School of Business is the West's oldest continuously operating business college.[139] It offers a number of graduate and undergraduate degrees in fields including management, accounting, economics, finance, and management information systems (MIS). The bachelor's degree in international business is unique to USU within the state.[140] The prestigious School of Accountancy is distinguished by perennial Top 5 rankings in CPA exam scores by its grad students. In 2014, 75.3% of its students passed the CPA exam placing the program 21 out of 254 institutions in the nation under the large programs classification.[141] U.S. News & World Report ranked the Huntsman School 183 nationally for business programs.[142] Its Institute of Management Accountants chapter has received a "Gold Level Award of Excellence" for each of the past 14 years essentially making it the top such institute in the nation.[143] The Huntsman School widely touts its travel programs, including the unique Huntsman Scholar Program,[144] and the impressive transformation it is undergoing as it puts its new resources to use. This effort has included the hiring of high-profile faculty, such as Stephen R. Covey, influential management scholar and author of the wildly popular best-seller The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. Covey taught classes from 2010 until his death in 2012.[145]

The Huntsman School of Business also houses the Shingo Institute, an outreach program that develops executive education to be licensed and taught to leaders of organizations worldwide.[146] The Shingo Institute also administers the internationally recognized award, the Shingo Prize for Operational Excellence.[147]

In 2011, the Utah Legislature approved funding for a new business building to be located south of the Eccles Business Building.[148] The new building was funded by $36 million in private funds and $14 million in state funds.[149] The 117,000-square-foot (10,900 m2) building was completed in 2016 and includes classrooms, faculty offices, a business library and three new business centers.[150]

S.J. & Jessie E. Quinney College of Natural Resources[edit]
 The Natural Resources building.
USU has a long and illustrious history in the science and management of forests, rangeland, wildlife, and fisheries and watersheds.  Many graduates of the Quinney College of Natural Resources have gone on to high-level careers in the National Forest Service, National Park Service, and the Bureau of Land Management, and its graduate programs attract high numbers of international students.  The college also operates the Quinney Library, which houses collections relevant for natural resources education, management, and research.[151] The college was formally renamed the S.J. and Jessie E. Quinney College of Natural Resources in 2012 after a $10 million donation was received by the S.J. and Jessie E. Quinney Foundation.[152][153] The Quinneys were both graduates of USU (then the Agricultural College of Utah), and their foundation has supported the College of Natural Resources for 40 years, contributing more than $40 million in all.[154]

The Quinney College of Natural Resources includes the departments of Watershed Sciences, Environment and Society, and Wildland Resources.[155]
