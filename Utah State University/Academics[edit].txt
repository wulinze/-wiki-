As of Fall 2015, Utah State University enrolled 28,622 of whom 25,259 were undergraduate students and 3,363 were graduate students.[156] 17,901 of these students were enrolled at USU's Logan campus while 10,721 students were enrolled exclusively at regional campuses or in distance education.[156] USU is home to more Carnegie Professors of the Year than any other school in Utah, and boasts nine of the last 15 for the state.[75][157] The Carnegie is a teaching award, and in fact, USU strongly stresses close undergraduate involvement for even their most prestigious faculty.[158] According to a recent survey, 49.7% of all faculty teach undergraduates, and 63.5% say they've worked with an undergraduate on a research project in the last two years.[75] The university is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.[159] USU is also home to a dynamic and successful Honors Program.[160]

Student to Faculty ratio at Utah State University is 21.5 to 1.[6] Admittance rate, that is the percentage of total applicants that are admitted, is 97%.[161] SAT composite range for the students is 970-1240. ACT composite range for the students is 20-27.[162]

According to Business Insider in 2015, USU is the 25th "Most Underrated College" in the United States.[172]
In several specialized categories where cost of living in the area is factored in, Utah State University has received high national rankings. This is helped by low-income economy in the Cache Valley (where the City of Logan is located)[173][173][174][175]

As reported by Forbes in 2015, the annual cost for a student at USU is $30,100, which is approximately half compared to costs at an Ivy League university such as Harvard ($62,250), Yale ($63,970) or Princeton ($58,965).[176][177][178][179] The student to faculty ratio at USU is 21.5; this is considerably higher than the ratio at Ivy League schools, where student to faculty ratio is between 6 and 7 (i.e., 6 to 7 students per faculty member).[6][162]

U.S. News & World Report ranked USU No. 14 for Best Online Bachelor's Programs in 2017.[180] The Princeton Review has ranked Utah State among the "Best Western" schools for many years,[181] and Popular Science called it one of the Top 10 Smartest Schools in the nation.[182] "Forbes" ranked the university No. 95 in Public Colleges, No. 137 in Research Universities, and No. 65 among colleges in the West.[176] The university also leads the nation in funding for aerospace research and the number of student experiments actually sent out into space.[112] Various entities within the university have received high departmental rankings, such as the Emma Eccles Jones College of Education and Human Services, which ranks 2nd in the nation for total research dollars received by any one college, and in the top 2% for all graduate colleges of education.[132] The athletics program recently won a National Championship for most sports success per dollar spent.[183] By way of research and development expenditures, Utah State University is ranked No. 79 in the nation among public universities by the National Science Foundation.[184] In 2017, Utah State University was ranked No. 1 in the nation by MSN among 1,600 considered schools "based on affordability, flexibility, and other quantitative factors."[185]

Cache County, in which USU is located, had an estimated 120,783 residents in 2015 of whom 17,901 residents or 14.8% were Utah State University students.[186] Cache County had a median household income of $50,367 as of 2014 and the U.S. had a median household income of $53,657 during the same year.[186][187] Cache County's per capita income was $20,195 and the United States' per capita income was $28,889 in 2014.[186][188] Cache County reported a higher-than-national-average 3.14 persons per household in 2014 during which the U.S. average was average was 2.63.[186][189] Despite a reported median household income that was 6.1% less than the national median in 2014, Cache County is said to be safe.[190] It is ranked as the No. 1 safest U.S. metropolitan area,[191] No. 7 "Safest College Campus in the United States,"[192] No. 3 in "Best Cities to Find a Job",[193] and No. 10 in "Best Small Places for Business and Careers".[194]

Utah State University is classified by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching as a research university with "high research activity."[195] The National Science Foundation ranked USU 115 in the nation and 2 in Utah for research and development expenditures having recorded $164.8 million in 2014.[196] As of 2016, USU received more than $240 million is research support.[197] In addition to its faculty and graduate work, the university strongly emphasizes the importance of undergraduate research.[198] USU's Undergraduate Research program was founded in 1975 making it the second program of its kind in the nation with Massachusetts Institute of Technology founding the first.[199][200]

Along with the University of Utah, USU is an anchor in the Utah Science Technology and Research (USTAR) program, which is aimed at optimizing the university and region's most marketable strengths with the goal of bolstering Utah's high-tech economy.[201] Seven USTAR teams currently perform research at Utah State.[202] USTAR and USU's Advanced Transportation Institute developed charging technology for electric buses.[203] Now, buses can be powered through wireless induction technology. The bus stops over magnetic pads that will charge the bus while passengers load and unload. A prototype of the technology began service on the University of Utah campus in 2012.[204][205]

Notable research centers based at USU include the Space Dynamics Laboratory,[206] Energy Dynamics Laboratory, Utah Water Research Laboratory,[207] Center for High Performance Computing,[208] Utah Climate Center,[209] Center for Advanced Nutrition,[210] Center for the School of the Future,[211] National Aquatic Monitoring Center,[212] Intermountain Center for River Rehabilitation and Restoration, Mountain West Center for Regional Studies,[213] and Utah Botanical Center,[214] among others. In 2010, the university received ownership of the more than $30 million Swaner Preserve and EcoCenter outside of Park City.[215] The center consists of a 1,200-acre (4.9 km2) land trust and a 10,000-square-foot (930 m2), state-of-the-art facility dedicated to environmental education.[216][217] The preserve protects critical wetland and foothill terrain in the heart of one of the state’s fastest-growing areas, and the EcoCenter, completed in 2009, is a multi-use facility with space for educational and community activities.[218] The facility is LEED Platinum Certified, the highest standard for design, construction and operation of high-performance green buildings.[219]

Through the Department of Physics (College of Science), Utah State University has placed more student experiments into space than any educational institution in the world.[220] A team of USU and University of Idaho researchers were the first in the world to successfully clone an equine.[221] The baby mule, named Idaho Gem, was born May 4, 2003.[222] USU researchers made headlines in 2011 after breeding transgenic goats.[223] Utah State University professor Randy Lewis' "spider goats", the milk of which contains spider silk, are being studied for uses including human muscle tissue and light-weight bulletproof vests.[224]

Research efforts are underway to produce a cost-competitive bio-diesel from algae. Lance Seefeldt and other professors formed the Biofuels Program at Energy Dynamics Laboratory to develop new and emerging technologies that will produce methane, biodiesel, hydrogen and alcohols from renewable, carbon-dioxide-neutral energy sources, such as consumer and agricultural waste and sunlight.[225] Dallas Hanks, a doctoral student, has initiated a program at the university called FreeWays to Fuel, which is growing oilseed crops for biodiesel in previously unused municipal land such as highway roadsides. Hanks estimates that in the U.S., 10 million acres (40,000 km2) of such unused land exists—land which generally serves no other purpose and currently costs tax dollars to maintain. Early yields from the crops are promising, and the program has spread to other land-grant universities across the nation. He has a goal to produce 50 million US gallons (190,000 m3) of biofuel in five years.[226]

Utah State University promotes the OpenCourseWare (OCW) Project (open and free university courses) and is developing an open content management system for OCW called eduCommons. This open source content management system is one of the important technology projects in the MIT OpenCourseWare Initiative. eduCommons aids in the creation of OCW sites and has already been adopted by several universities for this purpose.[227]
