The Utah Statesman, or simply The Statesman, and Hard News Cafe are the primary news outlets that serve the USU student body. The Statesman is a student-run paper with a faculty adviser. The paper is funded partly by a student fee of $2 per semester[252] and partly by the sale of advertisements. The Statesman is published twice a week and distributed free of charge on campus and to certain off-campus USU offices. The Statesman won the Society for Professional Journalist's Best Column Writing award in 2002 and Best Non-Daily Student Paper in 2005.[253][254] Hard News Cafe is a news website operated by USU's Department of Journalism and Communications.

Utah Public Radio, based at the university in the MDLS building, is heard on KUSU (91.5 FM) and KUSR (89.5 FM) in Logan, and throughout Utah on a system of 26 translators.  UPR broadcasts "a mix of information, public affairs, and fine arts programming."[255] KUSU is a National Public Radio member station, and an affiliate of Public Radio International. In addition, an entirely student-run radio station called Fusion HD3 broadcasts on the third HD channel of 89.5 in Cache Valley and online.[256]

Aggie Television (ATV) is a cable service lineup of approximately 110 channels offered free of charge to all on-campus residents.  ATV produces Crossroads, a bulletin/announcement channel; and Aggie Advantage, providing local and student video programming.[257]
