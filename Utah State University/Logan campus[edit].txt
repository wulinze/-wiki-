USU's main campus in Logan is situated on about 400 acres (1.6 km2), approximately one mile northeast of downtown Logan, at the mouth of Logan Canyon.[6] The campus lies on a "bench," or shelf-like foothill overlooking the valley to the west. Mount Logan and the Bear River Range rise sharply to the immediate east. The campus contains more than 100 major buildings.[72] Most student activity is centered around the south end of campus, which is home to the vast majority of academic departments, the Quad, the Taggart Student Center, and the Old Main building.

Notable structures include Old Main, the college's first building, as well as the Merrill-Cazier Library, the 305,000 sq ft (28,300 m2) main university library, which houses more than 1,800,000 total volumes.[73] The library also boasts an extensive special collections and archives area, an automated storage and retrieval system, and more than 150 workstations and 33 group study rooms.[74][75] Also notable is the Manon Caine Russell-Kathryn Caine Wanlass Performance Hall, said to contain some of the best acoustics in the entire Western United States.[76]

The Logan City Cemetery splits much of the campus in half. To the south lie most academic buildings, and to the west and north are situated the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum and Merlin Olsen Field at Maverik Stadium, respectively. Many scientific and agricultural research buildings are located even farther north. Nearby Logan Canyon is a popular recreation destination for students, with a system of trails and parks running along the river. In addition to camping and hiking, the canyon also serves as the primary route to nearby Beaver Mountain Ski Resort and Bear Lake. The university's Outdoor Recreation Program[77] rents camping, water sports, mountain sports, and winter sports equipment to students, as well as providing them with area trail maps and expertise for their ventures into the canyon and elsewhere.[75]
