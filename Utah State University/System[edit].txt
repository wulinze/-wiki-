 USU Regional Campuses and USU Eastern provide education throughout the State of Utah. Distance Education centers and Extension sites exist in every county in Utah.
As Utah's land grant university, the Utah State University system operates throughout the state of Utah.[27] The earliest roots of USU's distance education go back to 1904 when USU professors traveled by train from Logan to Burley, Idaho to deliver dairy lectures.[58] In the 1950s, professors regularly drove around the state to teach courses and advise students. The first regional campus, Uintah Basin, was designated by the Utah State Legislature in 1967.[58] The next year, "flying professors" traveled weekly to teach at USU's various campuses and centers. Traveling to-and-from the centers was necessary until satellite systems were installed in 1996.[citation needed] In 2005, University President Stan Albrecht established USU Regional Campuses and Distance Education.[citation needed] The system grew in 2010 with the addition of USU Eastern to nearly one half of USU's enrollment.[58] Today, the USU system includes the College of Eastern Utah, 3 Regional Campuses, 21 Distance Education centers, and 30 Extension sites.[citation needed] In 2012, RCDE completed construction of the Regional Campuses Distance Education (RCDE) Building which houses broadcast classrooms, RCDE offices, and the Utah Education Network.[59]

Utah State University Eastern[edit]

Located in Price, Utah, the former College of Eastern Utah joined the USU system in 2010 and became Utah State University College of Eastern Utah (USU Eastern).[60] In 2013, the official name was shortened to Utah State University Eastern.[61] USU Eastern operates a satellite campus, known as the Blanding campus, in Blanding, Utah.[62] Before the merger, USU taught courses at the college through Regional Campuses and Distance Education (RCDE).[citation needed] USU Eastern is a junior college and offers associate degrees, certificates, and vocational programs. Bachelor's, master's and doctoral courses, however, are available on site through RCDE. USU Eastern competes as the Eastern Utah Golden Eagles and is the only campus besides Logan that has an athletics program.[63]

Regional Campuses and Distance Education[edit]

Regional Campuses and Distance Education (RCDE) work to fulfill USU's land-grant mission to increase access to a high quality education throughout the state of Utah.[64] Growth of RCDE is outpacing that of the Logan campus with enrollment up 4.5% to 12,650 students enrolled in RCDE courses in 2011.[65]

Regional campuses exist in Brigham City, Tooele, and the Uintah Basin (Vernal and Roosevelt). RCDE offers courses at Price and San Juan campuses that constituted the former College of Eastern Utah (now known as Utah State University Eastern). Distance Education operates 21 education centers throughout the state including Moab, Kaysville, Ephraim, Orem, and Salt Lake City.[66] At each of these locations, students may receive a wide selection of degrees without ever stepping foot on the Logan campus. Courses and degrees are also made available online through Distance Education.[67]

USU has a growing presence in Moab, which had 295 students in 2011.[58] The City of Moab committed up to $75,000 per year over the next 10 years to promote the development of the campus.[58] Degrees specific to the needs of the community, including social work and recreation resource management, are planned for the new campus.[68]

Cooperative Extension[edit]
Started in 1914, Utah State University Cooperative Extension, referred to simply as Extension, provides research-based, unbiased information to communities through their county offices and are an integral part of a land-grant institution.[69] Extension operates 30 offices throughout the state, which include Swaner EcoCenter, Thanksgiving Point, and the Utah Botanical Center.[70] With a focus on teaching, research, and public service, Extension programs include 4-H, agribusiness, Expanded Food and Nutrition Education, gardening and yard care, personal finance, and animal health.[71]
