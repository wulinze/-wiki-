 Aggie fans cheer on their team at the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum
The men's basketball team plays in the Dee Glen Smith Spectrum, which has been named among the nations "15 Toughest Places To Play In College Basketball."[237] ESPN has also named USU's student section, The HURD, among the smartest in the nation.[238] During the 2008–09 season, USU's ranking in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches' Poll rose as high as #17.[239] USU basketball was 193–13 (.937) at home during the Stew Morrill era, having received 6 NCAA Tournament berths in between 2000 and 2010, and amassed more wins than any team in the nation except Duke, Kansas, and Gonzaga during that time.[240] Tim Duryea was named the head coach for men's basketball prior to the team's 2015–2016 season.[241]

USU's football team is one of 128 schools in the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the United States. After many years of futility in football, USU rose to new heights under head coach Gary Andersen, ending the 2012 regular season with its USU's first-ever 10-win season,[242] its first Western Athletic Conference championship in football,[228] and nationwide Top 25 rankings in all three major polls.[243]

In addition to Andersen's hiring, the football program's renaissance can be attributed in part to a recent emphasis, under Athletics Director Scott Barnes, on recruiting, TV coverage, fundraising, facilities upgrades, and internal reorganization, despite the athletics department's dismal budget in comparison with other state and WAC schools. In recognition of these efforts, USU Athletics was crowned the 2009 National Champion of the Excellence in Management Cup, which seeks to identify the university that wins the most championships with the lowest expenses.[183] Matt Wells was named head coach of USU's football team prior to the 2013–2014 season.[244]
