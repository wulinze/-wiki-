 Modeling of the spread of disease using Cellular Automata and Nearest Neighbor Interactions
Depending on the institution and particular definitional boundaries employed, some major branches of bioengineering may be categorized as (note these may overlap):

Biomedical Engineering: application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes[17]
Tissue Engineering
Genetic Engineering
Neural engineering
Pharmaceutical engineering
Clinical engineering
Bioinformatics
Biomechanics
Biochemical Engineering: fermentation engineering, application of engineering principles to microscopic biological systems that are used to create new products by synthesis, including the production of protein from suitable raw materials[17]
Biological Systems Engineering: application of engineering principles and design concepts to agriculture, food sciences, and ecosystems.[7]
Bioprocess Engineering: develops technology to monitor the conditions of the where the process of making pharmaceuticals takes place[17], (Ex: bioprocess design, biocatalysis, bioseparation, bioinformatics, bioenergy)
Environmental Health Engineering: application of engineering principles to the control of the environment for the health, comfort, and safety of human beings. It includes the field of life-support systems for the exploration of outer space and the ocean[17]
Human-Factors Engineering: application of engineering, physiology, and psychology to the optimization of the humanâ€“machine relationship[17]
Biotechnology: the use of living systems and organisms to develop or make products[18]. (Ex: pharmaceuticals)[17]
Biomimetics: the imitation of models, systems, and elements of nature for the purpose of solving complex human problems. (Ex: velcro, designed after George de Mestral noticed how easily burs stuck to a dog's hair)[19]\
Bioelectrical Engineering:
Biomechanical Engineering:
Bionics: an integration of Biomedical, focused more on the robotics and assisted technologies. (Ex: prosthetics)[17]
Bioprinting: utilizing biomaterials to print organs and new tissues[20]
Biorobotics: (Ex: prosthetics)
Systems Biology: The study of biological systems.
